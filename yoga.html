    Yoga is a holistic system that originated in ancient India and has been practiced for thousands of years. 
    It encompasses a wide range of physical, mental, and spiritual practices aimed at achieving overall well-being and self-realization. 
    The word "yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," which means to yoke or unite, reflecting the integration of mind, body, and spirit.
    Yoga includes a variety of physical postures or asanas designed to promote strength, flexibility, balance, and coordination. 
    These postures also help to enhance physical health and reduce stress.
    This is the practice of focused concentration, often combined with meditation. 
    By directing attention inward and concentrating on a single point or object, practitioners aim to achieve a state of deep concentration and mental clarity.
